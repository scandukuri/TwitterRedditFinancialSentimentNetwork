# Twitter/Reddit Financial Sentiment Network

This is a repository for my team's Winter '23 group project for Stanford's CS224N: Natural Language Processing. It involves training and evaluation of a few deep learning models to predict mean stock prices and covariances given sampled Reddit and Twitter posts, as well as historical stock prices. We then use these predictions to generate paper trading strategies for the stocks of interest and evaluate the return on those strategies.
